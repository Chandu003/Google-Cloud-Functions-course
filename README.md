# Google Cloud Functions Demo
## Starting a Project
To start a new project in google cloud, we can go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) or create it from [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.google.com).
## Creating a virtual environment
First we have to install `python-venv` with the following command:
```
pip install python-venv
```
Then, we execute the following command:
```
python -m venv venv
```
To activate the virtual environment we do:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
In order to add new packages to our new virtual environment we create a file called requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
